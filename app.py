    Contemporary labor markets are being shaped by ongoing demographic changes, shortages of skilled workers, and the resulting 
    long-term challenges for pension systems. In this context, it is increasingly important to analyze both structural and socio-economic 
    inequalities at the national level - particularly in countries like France, which stands as the second-largest contributor to the European 
    Union‚Äôs Gross Domestic Product [(GDP)](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/facts-and-figures-european-union_en). 
    In 2022, the **√éle-de-France region** was the [single largest regional contributor to GDP in the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Economy_at_regional_level) :chart:, 
    significantly outpacing other regions across the Union.
    
    Economic growth and social prosperity can only be sustained if we ensure **equal pay** :scales: and equal opportunities for women in the workplace, especially given that women begin to outnumber men in France 
    already in their twenties. This is not only a matter of fairness, but also one of economic urgency: societies and their pension systems will increasingly depend on fully integrating women‚Äôs potential into 
    the labor market.

    - The primary dataset is from 2014, making it 11 years old. Despite extensive searching, no newer equivalent dataset was found. To show trends, we included additional statistics illustrating how the gender pay gap changed from 2014 to 2023.
    - Two company-related datasets were used:
      One shows the number of companies by size within each city.
      The other shows the number of companies by sector.
      Neither dataset includes information on the number of employees per company.
    - The salary dataset provides average net hourly wages per city or commune, but does not report how many individual salaries were used to calculate the averages.
    - The population dataset includes total population, age structure, and household arrangements per locality. It does not include information on employment status (e.g. employed, unemployed, self-employed, retired).
    - To improve representativeness, we combined the population dataset with others to allow group-level analysis by city size. However, its large size increases loading times and computing requirements.
    - In some cases, assumptions were needed. For example, the higher executive pay gaps in male-dominated sectors may reflect the underrepresentation of women in high-paying leadership positions.
    - The ‚Äúcompany‚Äù (co) and ‚Äúcompany by sector‚Äù (seco) datasets include variables with unclear background:
      The variable ‚Äòna_size_co‚Äô refers to businesses of unknown or zero size, containing self-employed individuals or bankrupt companies.
      The variable ‚Äòother‚Äô includes unspecified industries.
      These were excluded from percentage-based analyses due to lack of detail.
    - The ‚Äúsalary‚Äù (sa), ‚Äúcompany‚Äù (co), and ‚Äúcompany by sector‚Äù (seco) datasets each include a different number of city entries. During merging, some cities were dropped, which affected visualizations and analyses. As the general proportions remained consistent, we continued the analysis with the available data.

    improved healthcare and longevity, and lower birth rates during World War II (1940-1944). Migration had less impact on these older age groups.

    <p class="big-font">The chart illustrates a significant portion of the population lives in family structures with children. Adult couples with kids make up 23.9% of households,
    children living with two parents make up 22.1%, children living with one parent make up 6.7%, and adults living alone with kids make up 4.3%. The prevalence of families
    with children has several implications. Economically, it drives demand for childcare and schools, shapes housing needs such as the demand for larger homes, influences workforce participation,
    especially for parents, and affects consumer spending, such as on children's goods. Socially, it influences family support policies, parental leave, and child welfare, affects educational outcomes
    and child development, and shapes social cohesion and community structures. Demographically, it influences fertility rates and population growth, determines the future workforce size and composition,
    and impacts the dependency ratio, which is the ratio of non-workers to workers. Politically, it shapes political debates on family-oriented policies and influences government
    spending on education, healthcare, and social services for families.</p>

    Median salaries rise with age, but while men continue to see salary growth, women‚Äôs median earnings plateau after age 26. This suggests limited advancement opportunities for women, likely influenced by family responsibilities, part-time work, and concentration in lower-paying sectors.
    Men consistently earn more than women in every age group, with the gap widening significantly after age 50. High outliers among older men suggest access to top-paying roles, a trend less evident for women.
    Reflecting findings from <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/resources/article/2014/france-effect-motherhood-employment-public-and-private-sectors?utm_source" target="_blank">national studies</a>, these patterns demonstrate how caregiving and societal expectations can hinder women‚Äôs career progression and financial outcomes over time.

        - Cities with a negative executive pay gap (62 cities, all under 3,000 residents)
        - Cities with a high executive pay gap (85 cities, all under 2,000 residents)

        In both groups, the consumer sector shows a strong correlation with the total number of companies, suggesting that small cities may lean toward local retail-based economies.

        In cities with a negative executive pay gap, we see a strong correlation with companies in the health, education, public, and social sectors‚Äîareas typically associated with a higher share of female employment. This supports the idea that dominant sectors may help explain elevated female executive earnings.

        While we cannot confirm the relationship definitively, earlier research points in the same direction. For example, studies such as the [ISERT report](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/resources/article/2014/france-effect-motherhood-employment-public-and-private-sectors) link lower pay gaps to improved work-life balance in the public sector‚Äîan important factor during child-raising years.

        In contrast, technology companies appear less frequently in cities with negative pay gaps, but are more common in small cities with high gaps. This contrast is also reflected in correlation coefficients: 0.68 for the negative-gap cities and 0.84 for the high-gap cities.

        These observations also reinforce the pattern seen in the earlier pairplot, where cities with lower tech-sector presence tended to show reversed or smaller pay gaps.

        To examine whether the observed patterns are statistically meaningful and potentially generalizable, we next apply an ANOVA test.

        The ANOVA test helps identify whether average pay gaps differ significantly across cities with varying sector concentrations.

        We used the share of companies per sector (e.g., technology_pct, consumer_pct) and compared these with pay gap classifications (negative, low, medium, high) across hierarchy levels like executive and employee.

        **Limitations of ANOVA Test**  
        ANOVA tells us if there are statistically significant differences between groups, but not in which direction or why. A significant result signals association‚Äînot causation‚Äîand may reflect complex or non-linear sector effects.

        There is no statistically significant relationship between public sector share and executive pay gap categories. This aligns with previous visualizations: public sector employment appears fairly stable across pay gap levels.

        **Test result:** p-value = 4.63e-28 ‚Üí H0 rejected  
        A strong statistical relationship exists between the consumer sector and employee pay gap categories. While wages here tend to be lower, this sector‚Äôs presence appears to shape local pay gap patterns.

        **ANOVA Test: Technology Sector vs. Employee Pay Gap**  
        **Test result:** p-value = 7.25e-13 ‚Üí H0 rejected  
        Technology sector share is also significantly associated with employee pay gap levels. The test does not tell us if gaps are higher or lower‚Äîonly that meaningful differences exist.

        **ANOVA Test: Finance/Real Estate vs. Employee Pay Gap**  
        **Test result:** p-value = 0.000081 ‚Üí H0 rejected  
        Although the finance and real estate sectors have fewer firms overall, they show a notable association with different categories of employee pay gaps. When we look at manager and executive pay gaps versus the share of finance and real estate companies in our pairplot above, we observe that cities where women earn more than men in these roles tend to have a higher proportion of firms in the finance and real estate sector. This suggests a possible link between sector composition and pay equity at senior levels and potentially at employee level.

        Interestingly, this pattern echoes what we see in Luxembourg, the EU country with one of the lowest ‚Äî and in recent years, even negative ‚Äî gender pay gaps. Luxembourg has a strong concentration of large financial companies, which may contribute to more equitable pay structures.

        
        This raises the question: could the finance and real estate sector be a driver of pay equity also for employees? Exploring this potential link could be a valuable direction for future research.

    Because of this outsized influence, we chose to compare some city datasets with and without Paris to avoid distorted interpretations ‚Äì something already familiar from our earlier regional analysis and comparing the average pay gap with business sectors.

    What we didn‚Äôt have time to fully analyze, however, was how company size is distributed across these cities, and whether certain industries contribute to these patterns. For instance, Toulouse appeared to have a relatively high share of small and midsize enterprises (SMEs). It would be interesting to investigate whether this distribution is linked to local industry structures, such as a higher concentration of startups or niche manufacturing firms, and how the relationship between industry type and company size influences the gender pay gap.

    As a starting hypothesis, we could explore whether tech-heavy cities tend to have more small firms and wider gender pay gaps, while finance hubs, often dominated by large corporations, like Luxembourg, exhibit narrower pay gaps. As this remains unconfirmed, it would require deeper research.

        Our regression analysis in Regional Economic Impact showed a clear link between company size, salary levels and a link to cost of living. Larger firms tend to offer higher wages, particularly in regions like √éle-de-France. A further step, if more time had been available, would have been to compare these salary patterns with the actual local cost of living. High salaries in cities like Paris may be offset by higher living expenses, affecting overall financial well-being as already indicated in our regional studies.

    st.markdown("""
    Our findings suggest that regional and sectoral patterns in corporate concentration shape both salary levels and inequality. While small businesses dominate numerically, large firms‚Äîespecially in √éle-de-France‚Äîhave a stronger impact on wages and tend to show wider gender pay disparities, particularly at the executive level.

    Though cost-of-living data was not available in our datasets, our regression analysis indicates that regions with more large companies often have both higher salaries and greater inequality. This underscores uneven access to financial stability and opportunity across regions.

    At the sector level, the technology industry stands out as closely linked to gender pay gaps‚Äîlikely due to its male-dominated leadership structures. Yet, change is on the horizon. Programs like DataScientest‚Äôs bootcamps are making tech careers more accessible and already draw strong female participation.

    Still, structural challenges persist. Many women adjust their careers due to caregiving responsibilities, which affects long-term earnings and financial security. Public investment in childcare and better support for care-sector professions remain critical.

    Looking ahead, policies like the [EU Pay Transparency Directive](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/equal-pay/eu-action-equal-pay_en) and increased access to training in high-growth sectors can help shift the balance. Long-term progress depends not only on gender, but also on addressing regional, sector-based, and life-stage inequalities in how opportunity is distributed.
